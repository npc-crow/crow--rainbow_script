Simple CSS that allows you to turn text or background elements into rainbow garbage. Index.html is a showcase of how this works.
foxrainbow.js is deprecated and should not be used - old spaghetti that runs badly.

crowrainbow.css:
Class  | Effect
------------- | -------------
crowRainbowText  | Rainbow effect on text.
crowRainbowBackground | Rainbow effect on background-color.
